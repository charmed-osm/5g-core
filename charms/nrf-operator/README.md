# nrf

## Description

Kubernetes charm to deploy NRF core component

## Usage

> This does not explain how to use it. Add similar steps to the ones in the main readme.
 - How to deploy it from the store
 - How to deploy it locally.

NRF requires  port and gin mode to be configured

## Developing

Create and activate a virtualenv with the development requirements:

    virtualenv -p python3 venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

## Testing

The Python operator framework includes a very nice harness for testing
operator behaviour without full deployment. Just `run_tests`:

    ./run_tests
